# GitHub Copilot Practice

This repository is a practice ground for experimenting with GitHub Copilot features, Python scripting, and code security improvements.

## Contents

- `newdir/copilot_test.py`  
  A Python script that demonstrates how to securely obtain system uptime information across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).  
  - Uses `subprocess.run()` and proper exception handling for robust and secure execution.

## Features

- Cross-platform system uptime retrieval
- Secure use of subprocesses (no `os.popen()`)
- Exception handling for reliable script execution
- Modular function-based design

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himasri999/github_copilot_practice.git
   cd github_copilot_practice/newdir
